### Differential Amplifier
The differential-pair or differential-amplifier setup is a fundamental and widely employed component in analog integrated-circuit design. 
It consists of two transistors, M1 and M2, whose sources are connected together. When the two transistors are subjected to different input voltages,
the currents through M1 and M2 will vary due to the gate voltages applied. However, if the gate voltages are equal, the currents through M1 and M2 will be the same
(Im1 = Im2). This configuration is referred to as a "Common-Mode Input Voltage Differential Amplifier." Regardless of the load resistor value,
it is crucial that the MOSFETs M1 and M2 do not enter the Triode region. It must be ensured that both MOSFETs remain in the Saturation Region.

#####Fig 1 : Differential amplifier image

This Experiement is done in 3 stages.Where common source terminal is connected with

1.Resistor

2.Current source

3.MOSFET

For all this circuit we need find out the AC analysis ,Transient analysis And Frequency Response.
##### The given question specification is as follows
P=2.5mA ,VDD=3.3V ,Vin=1.65V ,Vocm=1.7V ,Vp=0.5V
Iss=Id1=Id2=2.5/3.3=0.75mA
RD=VDD-Vocm/Iss= 3.3-1.7/0.37=4.32KΩ
Rss=Vp/Iss=0.5/0.75=666.6Ω
By tis value circuit is been built with respective to the values derived.
(Note:This value may change while getting the desired values in the saturation wise or some constant terms needs to set
###1.Circuit 1 (Common Source terminal is connected to resistor):

In this circuit we have two MOSFET connected to same voltage input forming differential pair.
And Load Resistor is coonected to the Drain terminal of MOSFET. Source terminal is connected resistor and another 
terminal is connected to ground this is called source degenration resistor.

The resistor applied at the common source terminal leads to change in the voltage gain ,input impedence in the circuit and the lineraity.
So the linearity increases and the impedence. As this is closed loop amplifier this leads to causes a feedbakback amplifier for all elements 
connecting to the common source terminal.
###DC analysis:
To do circit analysis first we need to check that the Both the MOSFET should be in the Saturation Region 
which should satisfy this.
