### Differential Amplifier
The differential-pair or differential-amplifier setup is a fundamental and widely employed component in analog integrated-circuit design. 
It consists of two transistors, M1 and M2, whose sources are connected together. When the two transistors are subjected to different input voltages,
the currents through M1 and M2 will vary due to the gate voltages applied. However, if the gate voltages are equal, the currents through M1 and M2 will be the same
(Im1 = Im2). This configuration is referred to as a "Common-Mode Input Voltage Differential Amplifier." Regardless of the load resistor value,
it is crucial that the MOSFETs M1 and M2 do not enter the Triode region. It must be ensured that both MOSFETs remain in the Saturation Region.
