### Current Mirror 
The current mirror is an analog circuit that senses the reference current and generates the copy or number of copies of the reference current, with the same characteristics. The replicated current is as stable as the reference current source. The replicated current could be the same as the reference current (Id = Iref),

##### Fig 1: Current mirror circuit.
The relation between the Id and Iref can be given by the following expression.

Id = ( (W/L)1 / (W/L)ref ) * Iref

By changing the W/L ratio of the two transistors, the current which is fraction or multiple of the reference current can be generated. The only thing which needs to be ensured is that, the MOSFET should operate in the saturation region.
