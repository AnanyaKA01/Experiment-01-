LT spice Simulation of Common source Amplifier

## 2)	Objective 
The objective of this report  is to use LTspice to examine a Common Source (CS) amplifier's performance utilizing DC, transient, and AC analysis. Determining the operating point (Q-point) and confirming biasing conditions are the goals of the DC analysis. Transient analysis is used to assess the dynamic behavior of the amplifier by monitoring its time-domain response to input signals. The frequency response, gain, bandwidth, and phase properties of the amplifier are ascertained using the AC analysis. To comprehend the amplifier's capabilities and constraints, the outcomes of these simulations will be contrasted with theoretical predictions.
